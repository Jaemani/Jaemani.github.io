## Problems with the previous plan
Although the plan was good. But while I'm trying to execute it, I've found several realistic problems.
- **Lack of Math Knowledge(Linear Algebra, Calculus)**\
so it was hard to understand the formula and explanation.
- **Different suggestions**\
I tried several LLMs(ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, Deepseek), but of course all of them have gave me the different answers.\
But for me, An Undergraduate Student, it was hard to select and modify the plan they gave me.
- **Different Focus**\
The LLMs have gave me very different answer when I change the terms. *(e.g efficient and fast -> efficient)*\
Even the focus were changing(too shallow, too many resources, out of scope)\
So I had to fixed my requirements and conditions.

## New method
1. **Ask again with Format, Role, Focusing point, Requirement, My situasion**\
    So I rewrote the prompt mentioning some of their answer.
    ```
    As a professional AI researcher. imagine you're making it for a student do entire questions
    [former CSV table format including data]
    keeping
    Advanced Focus: Resources go beyond undergraduate basics (e.g., introductory Python or linear algebra) and dive into theoretical and practical depths of ML/DL.
    Research-Oriented: Includes seminal papers and recent works to align with your goal of following cutting-edge research.
    Masterâ€™s Preparation: Structured to help you explore specializations (e.g., NLP, computer vision) and build a strong application profile.
    Evidence-Based: Recommendations are grounded in widely recognized materials used in academia and industry.
    [my-plan-period]
    [my-time-table]
    ```
    And I used the function (deep think/reason/... anyway)
2. **Let them judgement their responses**\
   I also requested to make CSV table of the plan.\
   And then copied All of them and ask again with the function
   ```
   1. [CSV1]
   2. [CSV2]
   3. [CSV3]
   which is the best of all?
   and which is the best of only study?
   ```
   I asked "only study" because their answer contained community, forum and Master preparation

## Got the Satisfactory grain
for my situation, it was Deepseek>ChatGPT>Grok>Claude\
also I was very amazed of Deepseek's analytical answers. The quality was pretty high.\
So, after some of formatting and adjustment. it is done!\
And I don't think I would change the plan even if I didn't complete it, I would just re-schedule to finish them.
