# To follow-up the latest research as an undergraduate student
Compared to the rapidly advancing technology, I'm still a sophomore in University.\
I really wanted to know like "How LLM Works?" or "What project can I do with CV?".\
I couldn't wait until I graduated, because I know even the people working on the field doesn't memorizing every details of academic basis. Bue they use the "Libraries".\
So I decided to learn some basic core knowledge that I can't learn from lectures.

## Looking for materials
after long times of googling, I've found out many famous books, papers, lectures.

*from paper we love*

But it is impossible to learn everything.\
I had to find a way to learn the whole picture while only learning the concepts I needed to know.\
I want no more details like "Hands-on MNIST training", "gradient descent", "What is Layer of Neural Network?".\
It would be very challenging to do this.

## Planning with chatGPT
So I asked chatGPT to not repeating the undergraduated knowledge, Make a quick-study guide.\
And then, he made it.\
After some of adjusting and formatting, I was able to got my weekly plan for 6 Month study.

## Allocate my time on the plan
due to my schedule of lectures, projects, and part-time job\
I have to allocate it properly and flexiblly,\
So I also asked chatGPT again.\

Although he only gave me two month of my plan, but I think it was okay.\
Before the semester starts, I would try this for few weeks.\
My Goal is **made a perfect weekly plan** for time-lacking environment.\
I cannot wait for next feedback.
