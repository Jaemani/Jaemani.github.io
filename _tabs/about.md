## 🛠 Projects & Research

### WakeUp App – Real-Time Eye-Closure Detection App (Google ML Project)
_Aug 2024 – Oct 2024_ 🔗 [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Jaemani/wakeup_app)

- Developed a mobile drowsiness detection system using **YOLOv5n** deployed on **Flutter**  
- Designed and executed a full ML pipeline: **data collection, labeling, cleaning, background removal, and augmentation**  
- Compared 4 YOLO variants using precision, recall, mAP, and **real-device latency** benchmarks  
- Selected YOLOv5n for mobile inference via **flutter_vision**, achieving ~96% precision with low latency
- Optimized detection accuracy from <40% to >99% confidence through multi-stage dataset refinement and model tuning
- Integrated app with **Firebase Auth**, **Cloud Firestore**, and **Cloud Functions** for real-time alert logging and location-based risk detection  
- Designed system architecture to include **geolocation (accident hotspot)** + **Gemini API (personal feedback)**  
- Collaborated using GCP and version control; documented results in a structured project repo and Notion workspace

### 📊 MNIST Regression Project (In Progress)  
_Apr 2025 – Present_  
- Implementing a regression model on the **MNIST dataset** using PyTorch  
- Investigating methods to infer **stroke-centered numerical outputs** instead of classification  
- Focused on evaluating loss behavior in continuous-valued output learning
