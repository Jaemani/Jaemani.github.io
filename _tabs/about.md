## 🛠 Projects & Research

### WakeUp App – Real-Time Eye-Closure Detection (Google ML Bootcamp 1st Place)
_Aug 2024 – Oct 2024_ 🔗 [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Jaemani/wakeup_app)

- Designed a real-time drowsiness detection system for drivers, deployed on mobile via **Flutter + Firebase**
- Built an end-to-end ML pipeline: collected raw eye data, removed low-quality/duplicate images, applied background removal and augmentation (~9,200 images)
- Evaluated and compared 4 models (**YOLOv5n, v5s, v8n, v8s**) for precision, recall, mAP, and **mobile inference latency**
- Initially explored **EfficientDet-lite**, **OpenCV + CNN**, and **CenterNet**, but ruled them out due to high resource demand and limited mobile compatibility
- Achieved over **99% detection confidence** (from <40%) after iterative dataset refinement and architectural tuning
- Integrated the optimized YOLOv5n model via **flutter_vision**, balancing accuracy and real-time performance on mobile
- Implemented geolocation-based risk alerts and real-time event logging using **Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Functions)**
- Proposed a Gemini-based advisory system for user feedback (under development); designed system for future scalability
- Collaborated in a 3-member team; used Git, Notion, and GCP for versioning, documentation, and deployment tracking  

### MNIST Regression Project (In Progress)
_Apr 2025 – Present_  
- Implementing a regression model on the **MNIST dataset** using PyTorch  
- Investigating methods to infer **stroke-centered numerical outputs** instead of classification  
- Focused on evaluating loss behavior in continuous-valued output learning

## 🧭 Research Goals

I’m particularly interested in developing machine learning systems that are not only accurate but also practically applicable—especially in high-impact areas such as accessibility, safety, and health.
I focus on designing models and interactions together, while optimizing for real-world constraints like deployment, usability, and latency.
My goal is to contribute to research that bridges technical depth with tangible social impact.
