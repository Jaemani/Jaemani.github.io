## 🛠 Projects & Research

### Hanwoollim Member App - Backend Developer
_Jun 2021 – Nov 2021_ 🔗 [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Jaemani/Hanwoollim-Server)

- Independently developed and deployed a production-ready RESTful API server for a university club app.
- Designed scalable MySQL schemas using Sequelize ORM
- Implemented secure login and authentication with JWT and Bcrypt.js
- Deployed on AWS (EC2, RDS) with NGINX for reverse proxy and process management
- Created clear API documentation for users and admins using SwaggerHub


### WakeUp App – Real-Time Eye-Closure Detection (Google ML Bootcamp 1st Place)
_Aug 2024 – Oct 2024_ 🔗 [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/Jaemani/wakeup_app)

- Designed a real-time drowsiness detection system for drivers, deployed on mobile via **Flutter + Firebase**
- Built an end-to-end ML pipeline: collected raw eye data, removed low-quality/duplicate images, applied background removal and augmentation (~9,200 images)
- Evaluated and compared 4 models (**YOLOv5n, v5s, v8n, v8s**) for precision, recall, mAP, and **mobile inference latency**
- Initially explored **EfficientDet-lite**, **OpenCV + CNN**, and **CenterNet**, but ruled them out due to high resource demand and limited mobile compatibility
- Achieved over **99% detection confidence** in real test (from <40%) after iterative dataset refinement
- Integrated the optimized YOLOv5n model via **flutter_vision**, balancing accuracy and real-time performance on mobile
- Implemented geolocation-based risk alerts and real-time event logging using **Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Functions)**
- Proposed a Gemini-based advisory system for user feedback (under development); designed system for future scalability
- Collaborated in a 3-member team; used Git, Notion, and GCP for versioning, documentation, and deployment tracking

### 수리수리 마수리 – Repair History System for Mobility Devices - Backend Developer
_Apr 2025 – Ongoing_ 🔗 Github Repo [Backend](https://github.com/Jaemani/power_assist_device_helper_backend/tree/main) [Frontend](https://github.com/oikkoikk/soo-ri
) / [Notion](https://jaeman-hyu.notion.site/1c4ec4b6449b80bca4f2d6413eb7e8ef?pvs=4)  

- Developed as part of Tech for Impact Campus, a social tech prototyping initiative by Kakao Impact, connecting universities and impact-driven organizations
- QR-based repair history platform for electric mobility devices, in collaboration with a local welfare center.
- Developed key backend modules using Next.js, Firebase Auth, and MongoDB, enabling role-based access and real-time repair tracking
- Led infrastructure setup and system integration; designed for future linkage with accident monitoring system (별따러가자)

### MNIST via Regression instead of Classification (Ready for Presentationing in progress)
_Apr 2025 – May 2025_ 🔗 [Notion Page](https://jaeman.notion.site/MNIST-via-Regression-1e95d7580ec180abaee4e429b7bb93bf?pvs=73)

- Designed image regression models using TensorFlow/Keras, exploring both MLP and CNN-based architectures
- Framed MNIST digit recognition as a regression task predicting continuous numerical values, not discrete classes
- Achieved strong performance with MSE = 0.41 (MLP) and MSE = 0.12 (CNN); rounded prediction accuracy reached 95.1% and 98.2% respectively
- Analyzed how spatial feature extraction prior to flattening (CNN) significantly reduced error compared to raw-pixel regression (MLP)

## 📚 Activities & Engagement

- **Google ML Bootcamp (2024)** – Selected as 3rd Cohort Project Member
Developed a full-stack ML mobile application as part of the official Google ML Bootcamp project track, from model training to app deployment 
- **Regular ML self-study**: Kaggle practice (regression, classification, CV)

## 🧭 Research Goals

I’m particularly interested in developing machine learning systems that are not only accurate but also practically applicable—especially in high-impact areas such as accessibility, safety, and health.
I focus on designing models and interactions together, while optimizing for real-world constraints like deployment, usability, and latency.
My goal is to contribute to research that bridges technical depth with tangible social impact.
